## Description

The **Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCV)**, commonly known as **Section 8**, is a federal program administered by the [Georgia Department of Community Affairs (DCA)](https://dca.ga.gov/safe-affordable-housing/rental-housing-assistance/housing-choice-voucher-program-existing-hcv). It provides rental assistance to low-income families, seniors, and individuals with disabilities to afford safe and sanitary housing in the private market.

Participants are free to choose any housing that meets program requirements, including single-family homes, townhouses, and apartments, as long as the landlord agrees to participate in the program.

## Eligibility

To qualify for the Housing Choice Voucher Program, applicants must meet the following criteria:

- **Income Limits**: Household income must not exceed 50% of the median income for the county or metropolitan area in which the family chooses to live, as defined by the [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il.html). Priority is often given to applicants with incomes below 30% of the area median income.

- **Family Composition**: Open to individuals, families, the elderly (62 years or older), and persons with disabilities.

- **Citizenship Status**: Must be a U.S. citizen or have eligible immigration status. [Source](https://dca.ga.gov/safe-affordable-housing/rental-housing-assistance/housing-choice-voucher-program-existing-hcv/eligibility)

Those with certain criminal histories, such as lifetime sex offender registration or recent drug-related offenses, may be disqualified.
