# Help - Georgia Resident Resource Assistance

## üöÄ Welcome to the Help Repository!

**Help** is an innovative, AI-powered resource assistance application designed to empower Georgia residents by providing easy access to essential information and services. Leveraging a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI, Help serves as your personal guide for navigating loans, assistance programs, permitting processes, and more.

## üåü Project Overview

The **Help** app aims to streamline access to government resources, making it easier for constituents to find and utilize the support they need. By centralizing links, resources, datasets, and other vital information, we create a comprehensive repository that not only serves as a knowledge base but also as the foundation for an intelligent assistant tailored to the needs of Georgia residents.

### Key Features:

- **Personalized Assistance:** Get tailored information and guidance on applying for loans, assistance programs, permits, and other services.
- **Comprehensive Repository:** Access a centralized collection of resources, including government links, datasets, and useful tools.
- **Open Government Initiative:** Promote transparency and accessibility by making government resources open source and easily reachable.
- **Community-Driven:** Collaborate with community members to continuously expand and enhance the repository.

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

The repository is organized to make it easy for anyone to find and contribute resources. Below is the structure:

- **`/resources`**: Contains all the resources, organized by category.
  - **`/[category]`**: Each category folder (e.g., `housing`, `education`) contains resources, links, and data related to that category.
    - **`[resource-name].md`**: Resource files in Markdown format.
    - **`/links`**: Contains link files in Markdown format.
    - **`/data`**: Contains datasets and their metadata.

- **`/contributing`**: Contains guidelines and templates for contributors.
