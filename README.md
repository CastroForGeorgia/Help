# Update: Improving How We Collect and Share Data & Moving to Hugging Face

**Dear Community,**

We’re always striving to provide you with the best and most useful resources through the Help app. To continue doing this responsibly, we need to make some changes to how we collect and share data. These changes ensure we respect copyright laws and protect your privacy.

## Why Are We Making These Changes?

You might wonder why we're updating our data collection and sharing methods. Here are the main reasons:

1. **Respecting Copyright Laws:** We want to make sure we're following all legal guidelines to protect creators' rights.
2. **Protecting Your Privacy:** We aim to keep your data safe and secure, ensuring it stays private.
3. **Enhancing Quality:** By refining our methods, we can provide better and more reliable resources for everyone.

## Our New Approach: Building Your Own Datasets

### What’s Changing?
Instead of sharing certain information publicly, we're introducing a way for you to create your own datasets directly on your device using your web browser.

### Why This Matters:
- **Legal Compliance:** This change helps us stay within copyright laws by not sharing restricted content.
- **Privacy Protection:** Your data stays on your device, keeping your information safe and private.

### How It Works:
You’ll use tools we provide to gather and organize data on your own computer. This means you have full control over your data, and it never leaves your device.

## Creating New Datasets Together

### Synthetic and Community-Generated Data
We will continue to create and share datasets that are:
- **Synthetic:** Made up using computer programs to simulate real data.
- **Community-Generated:** Collected from your questions and interactions within our community.

## Moving to Hugging Face

### What is Hugging Face?
Hugging Face is a popular platform where developers share machine learning models and datasets. It offers free hosting tools and a collaborative environment.

### Why We’re Moving:
- **Better Tools:** Hugging Face provides excellent resources that help us build and share our work more effectively.
- **Community Collaboration:** It makes it easier for you to contribute and collaborate with others.

### What You Can Do:
Visit our Hugging Face page [CastroForGeorgia on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/CastroForGeorgia) to follow our progress, explore our datasets, and access our models.

## Growing Together: Your Contributions Matter

### How You Can Help:
Your daily interactions and feedback are crucial. By contributing, you help us build better datasets and improve the Help app.

### Monitoring Our Progress:
We’re introducing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track how our data is growing and improving. This helps us ensure the quality of our resources and recognize your valuable contributions.

## Moving Forward

We’re excited about these changes and believe they will make the Help app even better for everyone. Thank you for your understanding and continued support as we implement these updates to serve you better while following legal and ethical standards.

**Sincerely,**  
**The Help App Development Team**

### **Key Points to Remember:**

- **Quality and Collaboration:** We continue to provide high-quality synthetic and community-generated datasets and move our projects to a collaborative platform.
- **Your Role:** Your contributions and feedback are essential in shaping and improving the Help app.
